SSH keys 
-	Id_rsa – “the key”  (private key)
-	Id_rsa.pub – given to external sytem  “the lock” (public key)
-	Public key file saved on laptop as ‘public key’

Amazon EC 2
-	Log into AWS -> services -> ec2 (within compute)
-	Setup SSH keys on ec2: import key pair, give it a name, and paste public key 
-	Launch a new instance 

Security Groups
-	create new security group (name unimportant) 
-	Potential Groups: 
-	type = SSH, port = 22
-	type = http, port = 80
-	type = https, port = 443
-	PostgreSQL, port = 5432
-	Custom TCP rule = 27016 (for mongo – note that typical port is 27017)
-	All source fields set to ‘anywhere’
-	create security group 

AWS Operating System
-	we use Ubuntu in the course – choose the ubuntu operating system that comes free 
-	to connect to the ubuntu system: use bash and type “ ssh: ‘public ip’ “

Docker Installation: In bash - 
-	curl - sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
-	sudo usermod – aG docker Ubuntu 
-	ctrl-d twice

Obtaining the correct Docker image
-	tmux
-	docker pull ‘jupyter/datascience-notebook
Running the correct Docker image as a container
-	docker pull hello-world 
-	docker run hello-world 
       **Tests docker connection**
-	once the download is complete: “docker run  -d -p 443:8888  -v /home/Ubuntu:/home/jovyan jupyter/datascience- notebook” (now denoted by j)
-	docker logs ‘first 3 #s of container id’ (retrieves token)
-	-use token in bash line into pw line (yes, the whole thing)

once the download is complete: 
-	“docker run  -d -p 443:8888  -v /home/Ubuntu:/home/jovyan jupyter/datascience- notebook” (now denoted by j)
-	docker logs ‘first 3 #s of container id’ (retrieves token)
-	-use token in bash line into pw line (yes, the whole thing

Jupyter notebook security concerns
-	to access notebook, input public IP address (found in EC2 launch summary) and add ‘:443’ 
-	important to use https port to connect because of the public state of the connection 
-	once connected to the server homepage, enter the hashed password (from ‘docker run...’ sequence in bash) to enter notebook securely
